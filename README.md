# credit-risk-classification

The goal of this machine learning model is to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers for a peer-to-peer lending services company.


Healthy Loans: 
The logistic regression model demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting healthy loans, with a precision of 100% and a recall of 99%. This indicates that when the model predicts a loan as healthy, it is accurate 100% of the time, and it successfully identifies 99% of all actual healthy loans.

High-Risk Loans: 
The model shows strong proficiency in predicting high-risk loans, with a precision of 85% and a recall of 91%. This means that 85% of loans predicted as high-risk are indeed high-risk, and the model correctly identifies 91% of all actual high-risk loans. While not perfect, these results reflect a solid capability in detecting high-risk loans, though there is room for improvement.

The model is highly effective at predicting healthy loans and performs well in identifying high-risk loans. Given the risks in lending, the emphasis on recall is recommended. This ensures that most high-risk loans are identified, which can help in minimizing financial losses and managing risk more effectively.
